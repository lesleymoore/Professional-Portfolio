## Project Notes

I created a Portfolio that will display my work for employers and other developers. I chose a color scheme and photos to display my work that is flexible and I am able to alter at any time through CSS. I wrote a HTML using semantic elements and relative classes and ids. I wrote the CSS to include media screens for an adaptible screen for tablets and mobile devices. I linked my first work Code Refractor, the others will be linked to real websites when I complete them. My Github, LinkedIn, and Resume are also linked. I included a photo of myself and small about me area so potential employers and other developers can get to know me from my page.
